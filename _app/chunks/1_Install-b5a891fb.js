<p><code>svelte-forms</code> first came out because there were back then, no real form validation library for svelte. I then decided to create one that was easy to use... or I thought it was.</p>
<p>The first version was taking advantage of the <code>onMount</code> method that could be used anywhere in the code and not just in a component; but a lot of issues started to arrive when <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">sveltekit</a> was announced.
Something shady, that was not really easy to fix because the library was tightly coupled to that famous <code>onMount</code> function.</p>
<p>A version 2 was quickly needed. Easier to use and easier to work on because it is developed using the sveltekit <code>package</code> command.
That makes possible to create the library as well as the documentation at the same time.</p>
<ul>
<li>So today, here we are with the v2 of <code>svelte-forms</code> that is hopefully easier to use and less bug prone for everyone!</li>
</ul>
